Get to know your current input source at a glance even in fullscreen apps.

## What is it?
* This OS X app shows a discreet floating indicator on top right corner of your screen if your current input source is for a specified language. 
* Bilinguals who happen to be fullscreen apps' fans usually found awkward when you start to type in one--is the current input source the one I want now?--since the system input source indicator is in the hidden menu bar. Of course you can try to type one key to see, or slide your trackpad to the top of the screen to reveal the menubar. However, this is intolerably lagging for highly effective people. If you feel the same, this app is for you.

## Usage
* This is a demo rather than a full-fledged app. I don't use fullscreen app very often so I'll probably leave it here. 
* Modify the language constant or other part of the code to whatever you want and compile with a modern Xcode. 
* How do you close the app? (Why someone wants to close it if he/she's gone that far?) Terminate it in Activity Monitor.
